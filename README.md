# TicTacToe
Personal project

Tic tac toe project undertaken for educational purposes. 

Goal: Train AI(s) to learn 5-in-a-row(Gomoku) game through observing a game being played between two players. 

Current: 
1. A random move generator (Amateur player) and a Minimax algorithm (Master player) has been created. 
2. Single player mode created to test the above and play against AI later. 

Next steps:
1. A-B pruning for the Minimax and create sample data set for learning (different board situations) and other optimizations. (anything bigger than 3X3 boards take too much time)
2 Learn the rules through association. 
3 Neural Net / Genetic Alg. 

NOTES:
Currently the default size is set to 3X3(hence the publishing name, Tic Tac Toe). '*' - general idea for now. Can change in the future. 

Thanks to Ben from "MakinggameswithBen" (https://www.youtube.com/user/makinggameswithben) for getting me interested game development and the 100+ tutorials on the subject. 
I've used his Tic Tac Toe glyph to draw out the board.
